Title: New date
Date: 2020-02-14 20:55
Category: General

Yesterday, we have finalized the procedure of rebooking the conference venue.
The new date will be March 21st, 2020.  (Original date was February 22nd.) We
move the date in response to [the delay of the
classes](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3869939) that is caused by the
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

If you have bought the ticket but the new date does not work for you, there are
two options.  The first is to find a new attendee yourself, and contact us
through [the event page](https://sciwork.kktix.cc/events/sciwork2020) to
replace the name.  Another way is to cancel it directly through kktix.
Cancellation may incur a process fee.  In either way, please discuss with us if
you have any question.
