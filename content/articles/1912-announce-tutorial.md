In the coming sciwork conference, we are planning for two hands-on tutorials to
introduce important programming skills to the audience:

- [Hypothesis Testing with Python](../../tutorial/hypothesis-testing.html)
  (Mosky Liu)
- [Packaging: Share your code for pip and Conda](../../tutorial/packaging.html)
  (Tzu-Ping Chung)

The lecturers have a lot of experience, and will guide the attendees to explore
the topics in the allotted 3 hours.

We will soon open for registration and every attendee can join either of both.
Please follow us [@sciwork](https://twitter.com/sciwork) to get the latest
updates!  Questions are welcome too.
