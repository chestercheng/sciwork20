Imagine you attend a technical conference that is full of great speakers and
amazing people, in a shiny building, and has well-organized schedule.  You
learn a lot from the technical program and make new friends.  It is all good,
and you enjoy it a lot.

But it will not be complete if there is no development sprint!  Development
sprints are the thing makes a technical conference really fulfilling.  In a
sprint, a group of people sit together and spend hours on the same project to
engage in intensive learning and code development.  It moves forward the
technology.  And technology is the reason for us to meet in the conference,
isn't it?

Sciwork is a conference for researchers and engineers to share and discuss
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.  We focus on
code, so the sprints are playing the central role.  Please take a look at our
two sprints: [uni10]({filename}/pages/sprint/uni10.rst) and
[libst]({filename}/pages/sprint/libst.rst).  You can select one of then when
you [register](https://sciwork.kktix.cc/events/sciwork2020).

Two sprints are too few or you want to work on something else?  No problem.
