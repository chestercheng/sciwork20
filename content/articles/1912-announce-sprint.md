Sciwork is a conference for numerical code, and we certinaly will let everyone
enjoy the coding hours.  In sciwork 2020, there are two development sprints:

- [Uni10]({filename}/pages/sprint/uni10.rst), a numerical library designed for tensor networks.
- [libst](sprint/libst.html), a code to solve conservation laws by using the
  space-time conservation element and solution element (CESE) method.

And it's just the beginning.  Sciwork is actually more than just a conference
and we will plan for additional development sprints during the year.  If you
are interested in a development sprint, or have any questions or comments, we
want to hear from you.  Please [email us](contact@sciwork.dev), tweet us

group](https://t.me/sciwork2020/).
