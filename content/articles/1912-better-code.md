It is a fascinating enterprise to study and improve the world by using
computers.  However, digital computers are sophisticated machinery.  To drive
it, we need both the knowledge of solving the scientific problems and the
skills for making the software.  It doesn't happen automatically.

Writing code for scientific or engineering applications has always been a
challenge.  Many practitioners, in both academia and industry, are struggling
with the code development.  We at sciwork would like to organize events to help
them get together, learn together, and improve the work together.

We believe code development and software engineering are the key to
high-quality results for computational science and engineering.  We hope in
sciwork to facilitate collaboration between scientists and software developers,
and find more systematic and efficient ways to make useful software for
scientific, engineering, and technical applications.

We welcome people at any level of understanding to science and software.  Look
forward to your participation!
