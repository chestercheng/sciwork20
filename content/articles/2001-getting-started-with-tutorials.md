Title: Getting started with sciwork tutorials

In the coming sciwork conference, we focus on code, and will help people who
are interested in the scientific software development to get started.  There
are two tutorials installed in the conference: ['Hypothesis Testing in
Python']({filename}/pages/tutorial/hypothesis-testing.rst) and ['Packaging:
Share your code for pip and Conda']({filename}/pages/tutorial/packaging.rst).
The two tutorials are aimed at different people.  Hypothesis testing will guide
programmers to learn basic statistics.  It is a concrete subject that will lead
to many applications, and very suitable for starting a scientific journey.

The second tutorial, on the other hand, is to help scientists to practice
software development.  It is commonplace for a program to run on one computer
but fail on another.  It takes some efforts to make the code to run on
different computers, and packaging is probably one of the prerequisites.

For programmers learning science and scientist learning software development,
we have the materials prepared.  You are invited to register now with the early
bird rate:
