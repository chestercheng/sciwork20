Yung-Yu Chen, conference chairman

Sciwork is a conference for researchers and engineers to share and discuss
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.  The software
calls for deep understanding to a complex problem domain, and the development
becomes much less understood by programmers.  We would like to connect
individuals and organizations who see the problems, and together improve the
art of developing numerical software.  We believe in the power of openness, and
will use open source as a platform for collaboration.

This is our first year holding the conference.  We hope to build a vibrant
community that write serious code for solving interesting problems.  The
conference will be held annually, and we plan to hold smaller sprint events
throughout the years.

The estimated attendance of the first conference is 70-100 people.  The
attendees are expected to be computational science researchers, software
developers, and university students from Taiwan.

The benefits of sponsorship include:

* Early participation of the emerging community for scientific code development
* Connecting highly motivated researchers and programmers
