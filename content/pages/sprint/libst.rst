Introduction
------------

libst_ is a code using the space-time conservation element and solution element
(CESE) method for solving conservation laws.  Currently it focuses on
one-dimensional equations.

Objective
---------

* Add documentation for building the project.
* Develop validating unit-tests cases for the two model problems

  - Linear wave
  - Inviscid Burgers' equation
* Make a prototype to allow writing solvers in Python.

Requirements
------------

Equipment:
  Laptop running Linux or MacOS (with wifi connectivity)

Software:
  Git_, Cmake_, Python_, Pybind11_, py.test_, xtl_, xsimd_, xtensor_,
  xtensor-python_

Good to know:
  Conservation laws
