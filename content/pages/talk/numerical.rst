Numerical Software and Open Source
==================================

Skills of programming and knowledge to computer science are required for proper
implementation of codes that solve scientific and engineering problems.
However, acquisition of the expertise is not a trivial effort.  Just like
scientific research, open source software development promotes the idea of
learning from doing, and uses openness as a means for efficiency.  It has been
known in the industries that open source software significantly improves
productivity.  The open source practices should also be used for scientific and
engineering software, and this talk discusses how.

Talk Description
================

Software development is more than just coding.  To develop fast and dependable
software, understandings to programming languages, design patterns, operating
systems, and computer architecture are all necessary.  It cannot be learned
without practice and open source software provides is a good (and probably the
most efficient) way to do it.

This talk will discuss the following topics that integrate numerical software
development with open source:

* Useful open source tools for numerical software
* Software engineering with open source infrastructure
* Interpreter and interface to C/C++
* Modern C++ code development
* Memory management
* Timing and optimization
* Design guidelines
* Packaging and deployment
