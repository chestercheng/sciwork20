Golang: Goroutines and Channels
===============================

Large programs often consist of many smaller sub-programs.  It would be ideal
for large programs to be able to run their smaller components at the same time.
The architecture is critical for modern services that serve as the consumer of
analytic code.  Go has rich support for this by concurrency primitives: using
goroutines and channels.  I will introduce how to achieve concurrency in Go.
