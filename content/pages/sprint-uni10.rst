Uni10 sprint
============

Project site: https://gitlab.com/uni10/uni10

Uni10 is a numerical library designed for tensor networks, which finds
applications in quantum physics, chemistry, data analysis and machine learning.
In this sprint, the participants will have the chance to work on different
parts of Uni10 to understand and improve cross-platform build using CMake, GPU
programming using CUDA, Python binding generation using pybind11, unit testing
using gtests and writing API documentation using Doxygen.  In addition, the
participants can get familiar with git workflow and CI/CD.  Furthermore,
multi-node/multi-gpu programming paradigm will also be explored.
