Sciwork is a conference to share and discuss computer code for scientific,
numerical, and engineering work.  Source code and the science it serves are the
center of the conference.  The focus areas include but are not limited to:

* Array processing
* Mathematical and numerical libraries
* Geometry and visualization
* Physics, chemistry, and their applications
* Other science and engineering
* C++, Python, and other programming languages
* Compiler, development environment, and software engineering
* High-performance computing, parallel computing, distributed computing, and
  concurrent computing
* Cloud, networking, and storage

Computational sciences need support from various computational skills.

The conference is in the preparation phase.  We plan to hold in Hsinchu, Taiwan
on Saturday, February 22nd, 2020 (two weeks after the Lantern Festival), and
call for proposals will start in September, 2019.

The program will be code-centric while balancing with the necessary verbal
discussions for understanding the scientific and mathematical background.  The
technical program includes:

* Six talk.  Each uses forty minutes.
* Two sprints.  Each uses three hours in the afternoon.
* Four hands-on workshops.  Each uses eighty minutes.
