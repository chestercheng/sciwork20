====================
Sciwork 2020 website
====================

This repository is for the website for the sciwork 2020 conference.  Check-ins
to the repository will be automatically deployed to the website by github
webhook.

The website is built by using `pelican <https://blog.getpelican.com/>`__.  The
flow for contribution is:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run a local devserver
3. Edit the content
4. File a pull request (PR) against *`develop`* branch
5. Resolve discussions in the PR review
6. PR is merged, done

.. note::

  Do NOT file PR aginast the `master` branch.

In the working copy root, run the following command for the local devserver:

.. code-block:: bash

  env SITEURL=http://localhost:8000 make devserver

Branch convention
=================

The `master` branch is automatically deployed to the official website
https://conf.sciwork.dev/2020/.

The `develop` branch is at https://under-development.sciwork.dev/2020/.  It
uses password protection to avoid public access.  The user name is `developer`.
The password is `sciworkdeveloper`.

Other branches will not be deployed.
